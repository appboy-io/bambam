Bam Bam! Hope you enjoy cloning and utilizing a simple performance measuring tool.

***How to Run It***
-------------------
Download the repo, and run the main.dart script
```dart
dart bin/main.dart
```

***Current State***
--------------
Currently the tool isn't robust at all. Currently you will manually have to alter the url in the stream class to get anything working. Future features coming to the repo:
* Command line arguments for customizing run
* Customizing test using json
* A packing build script to run this test in a Jenkins build
